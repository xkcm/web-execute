# web-execute
Web service built in **NodeJS** for executing shell commands on the server's system.

```
## Docs
### `/execute` endpoint

Send the `POST` request to the `/execute` URL with **JSON** object in the request's body:

```json
{
  "command": "your command here"
}
```

### Example
```js
fetch("http://localhost:4000/execute", {
  method: "POST",
  data: JSON.stringify({
    output: "uname -a"
  })
})
```

## Usage with frontend

There is also a simple frontend page available built in **Vue**. To run the app with frontend you have to switch to the `frontend` git branch and run `docker` again.
```sh
git branch frontend
docker-compose up --build # rebuild the containers if needed
```
